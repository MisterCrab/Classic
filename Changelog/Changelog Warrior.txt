[Warrior v4]
Added Loss of Control frames
Added condition to prevent actions from passive meta slots if something is already running in queue by Auto argument 
Changed default state as false on first launch for rage save by HeroicStrike exploit
Fixed isSafestThreatRotation		- miss typo (mostly seen with SunderArmor when it wasn't used in Tank role)

[Warrior v3]
Fixed Overpower 					- wasn't perform swing misses properly
Fixed Bloodthirst					- will bypass option for heroic strike trick rage save 
Fixed Bloodthirst					- more early pre use, now count current gcd with latency additionaly
Fixed HeroicStrike					- was taken value from Cleave power slider 

[Warrior v2]
Rotation reworked with better CPU optimization
HeroicStrike will exploit bug for damage increase if you playing with dual one hand weapons (StopCast checkbox must be enabled in General tab, required WeaponSwingTimer addon, itself checkbox for WeaponSwingTimer must be ON)
HeroicStrike will be unqueued if you reached highest threat which stated on UI slider (StopCast checkbox must be enabled in General tab only for that)
Burst timing adjusted by adding full gcd count in summary time 
Execute will suspend rotation if time to die to 20% on target will less than next 3 times of full gcd (still bypassed by overpower)
Whirlwind which is AoE 2+ units moved in priority below Execute 
Fixed Execute 						- removed condition for safest threat rotation since Execute isn't caused high amount of threat
Fixed MS BT 						- wrong rage calculation if you're not in berserker stance for WW
Fixed MightyRagePotion				- will be used now if rage < 15 and target health percent <= 20 or rage < 25 otherwise 
Fixed ShieldWall, LastStand			- unlogic usage by catch kill strike at begin of combat caused by invisible openers 
Fixed Hamstring (Flurry spam) 		- will check now attack types instead of slow types 
Fixed ShieldSlam PvP 				- purge on friendly target  
Fixed ShieldSlam					- removed tank role check 
Fixed Overpower						- conditions when he wasn't used sometimes in battle stance 
Fixed SweepingStrikes				- more correctly rage calculation to use on upper sweepings
Fixed SweepingStrikes				- missed rage limit 25 check (caused weird situations with stance swaps)
Fixed HeroicStrike, Cleave 			- missed unqueue if execute up 
Fixed PiercingHowl PvP 				- wrong unitID check in AoE 
Fixed ChallengingShout				- wrong unitID check in AoE 
Fixed Rend PvP 						- missed debuff check 
Fixed @mouseover 					- wrong behavior (mostly seen with Taunt by @mouseover while you had @target at same time)
